            Amazon makes use of the Visual Heirarchy well by placing all the user tools in the top bar of the page. 
            With all the user tools "out of the way" it allows them to fully advertise their productes without detracting from the user experience.
            It also shows what they think is important by having the products so big yet still "putting the customer first"

            TestOut has designed their website to be easy to use and quick to learn for new users.
            They have made the necessary buttons and paths easy to move to and find what you need.
            You can easily find the login button on PC view with it being circled, 
            and can find the menu just as easily with the options in the mobile view.

            "Just One Cookbook" is an excelent site that uses the rule of thirds very well. 
            By divideing and sectioning their recipies it makes them easily recognizeable and selectable.
            It also creates a clean clear and professional look for their website, making them seem trustworthy. 
            Even when looking at it in mobile view because each element is so clean it smoothly transitions into a single row containing the previos thirds.
